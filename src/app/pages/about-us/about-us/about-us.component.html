            <p>
                Starting from the naming rights of Hisense Arena in the Australian Open in 2008, Hisense has started a
                long-term sports association in line with its global brand image.
            </p>
            <p>
                In soccer, we were the Official Sponsor of the 2018 FIFA World Cup and the Official Partner of the UEFA
                EURO 2016.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hisense was also the official partner of UEFA EURO 2020. In the 60th year of the tournament, this is the
                second time Hisense joined in to be a global partner among other UEFA sponsors following a successful
                UEFA EURO 2016 campaign.
            </p>

                support its needs across its various facilities.

            <p>
                The soccer association continues with Hisense being the sponsor of the FIFA World Cup, Qatar 2022. At
