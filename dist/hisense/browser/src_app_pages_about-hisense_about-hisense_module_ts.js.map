                       <p class=\"hisenseLight expanded\">Hisense positioned the Laser TV as the next generation of TV, taking the lead in entering the field of laser TV in 2007 and obtaining the support from the National 863 Program.<br><br>The Laser TV is a disruptive and innovative product, and combines the advantages of projection technology and TV technology, which has reached or even surpassed the LCD TV in terms of user experience and image quality. By the end of October 2018, 503 patents for laser projection were applied for and 161 were authorized. 82 patents and inventions in foreign countries (United States, Europe) were applied for and 15 were authorized.<br><br>Hisense produced the world's first 100-inch ultra short throw laser TV, 100-inch 4K ultra short throw laser TV, ultra short throw dual-color laser TV and the world's first 300-inch laser cinema. At CES in 2019, Hisense released the 70-inch TriChroma laser TV, which is the first time for the industry to test the size of laser TV to 70 inches and is also the first time to apply the three-color laser display technology into small- and medium-sized televisions. <br><br>TriChroma laser TVs produce all colors by laser without any supplement of color wheel, almost meet 100% of the BT.2020 standard and is a true three-color laser TV. Three-color laser display is regarded as the ultimate solution to the laser display and its color expression is better than other display schemes known to mankind. Hisense has fully upgraded its display performance, sound effects and intelligent experience of the its laser TVs, which can meet the needs of users for all scenes of large-screen audio and video products in the home. After the 80-inch laser TV was marketed by Hisense, it became the CMM TOP 50 model in the first week of its listing with sales exceeding 2,500 sets within two months, leaping to TOP 1 in the 26th week, ranking TOP 10 steadily for several weeks, and becoming the most eye-catching and popular product in the industry since the second half of 2018. Hisense laser TV has also become the undisputed leader in the global laser TV market and the absolutely main force in the super-large screen TV market.</p>\r\n                            <div class=\"text-center text-expand d-none\">\r\n                                <img src=\"../../../../assets/about-hisense/overview/arrow.svg\" alt=\"arrow\" class=\"clicked\">\r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <div class=\"text-box trackin\">\r\n                        <div class=\"text-box-with-image\" style=\"background:url(../../../../assets/about-hisense/overview/backlight.jpg) no-repeat;background-position:center;background-size: cover;\" role=\"img\" aria-label=\"Hisense ULED Local Dimming Backlight Control Technology\">\r\n                            <div class=\"overlay-top-banner-bottom\"></div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        <div class=\"innovation-text-box trackin\">\r\n                            <h3 class=\"hisenseBold\">Hisense ULED Local <br><span>Dimming Backlight Control </span> Technology</h3>\r\n                            <p class=\"hisenseLight\">The Hisense ULED, with multi-zone local dimming backlight control technology as the core, combines wide color gamut and image processing technology to improve the image quality display effect of liquid crystal screen and contains more than 210 technological patent innovations. Hisense names this technology the \"ULED\" and \"U\" is short for \"ultra\", implying \"Ultimate\". In the 2016 evaluation by the School of Display Technology of Southeast University, the Hisense ULED is comparable to the OLED in view of comprehensive image quality performance.<br><br>In 2013, the Hisense ULED prototype products appeared at CES in the United States and won the \"Outstanding Innovations Design and Engineering Awards\".<br><br>In 2014, the first generation of 4K ultra-high definition ULED products went on the market.<br><br>In 2015, the second generation of Hisense ULED TV products won the \"Annual Golden Award for Display Technology\" at CES in the United States and were listed on European and American markets. The German authoritative Video Magazine gave ULED TV a 6-star top evaluation.<br><br>In 2016, the third generation of Hisense ULED TV products covered multiple sizes, which were listed in 57 countries and regions simultaneously, and exported the technology to the world.<br><br>In April 2017, Hisense released ULED U7 Series TV, the first customized World Cup product for fans around the world, which redefined the smart TV. In November 2017, Hisense launched the 2018 World Cup Limited Edition of 75-inch Hisense U9 Ultra Image Quality TV to the whole world. Hisense took the lead with the backlight zone control of 1000 Zone, pushing the ULED development to a new level.<br><br>The ULED TV has achieved perfect image quality expression with high contrast, high color gamut and high speed response, is equivalent to the OLED one in regard to color saturation and contrast performance and more advantageous than OLED one as far as brightness and technological maturity. Compared with common LED backlight products, the ULED ones have more obvious advantages, namely, the contrast can be increased by more than ten times and the color gamut range has reached 85%BT.2020. At present, for the ULED technology, Hisense has obtained 13 invention patents and successively secured patent authorization from the United States (Patent No.: US008031166B2) and Europe (Patent No.: EP2056284).</p>\r\n                            <div class=\"text-center text-expand d-none\">\r\n                                <img src=\"../../../../assets/about-hisense/overview/arrow.svg\" alt=\"arrow\">\r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <div class=\"text-box trackin\">\r\n                        <div class=\"text-box-with-image\" style=\"background:url(../../../../assets/about-hisense/overview/chip.jpg) no-repeat;background-position:center;background-size: cover;\" role=\"img\" aria-label=\"Hisense Image Quality Chip Technology\">\r\n                            <div class=\"overlay-top-banner-bottom\"></div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        <div class=\"innovation-text-box trackin\">\r\n                            <h3 class=\"hisenseBold\">Hisense <span>Image Quality Chip</span> Technology</h3>\r\n                            <p class=\"hisenseLight\">Founded in 2002, Hisense Chip Co., Ltd. is a world-class chip design enterprise specializing in digital audio and video image solutions.

For its ULED TV products, Hisense has comprehensively improved core performance such as screen brightness, contrast, layering, dark field details and response speed through independently developed ultra-quality processing technology and a new generation of \"Hi View\" chip. On this basis, Hisense has realized 4K display for its ULED TV and laser TV. At the same time, Hisense has also launched U9 series TV with the most partitions and the highest degree of image refinement in the world, realized the 8K display and is ready for the advent of 5G era.<br><br>In addition to 4k and 8K TV products, Hisense has also been continuously trying in the aspect of the replacement of old growth drivers with new ones and the industrial chain expansion. Hisense applied 4K and 8K image processing and display technologies into medical display and surgical scenes, and developed and launched 4K medical Consultation Display, 8MP HD Consultation Display, 4K Endoscope/OR Display, 4K Digital Operation imaging solution (from video capture to display and transmission are 4K system) etc. The ultra HD medical display marketing has a scale of billions of yuan.<br><br>Next, with the popularization of 5G technology featuring \"ultra-high network speed\" and \"ultra-low delay\", the transmission of 4K and 8K ultra-high definition contents will be no longer \"jammed\", which will greatly stimulate the demands of various industries for 4K and 8K ultra-high definition display products and open up greater market space for Hisense TV and Hisense smart medical products.</p>\r\n                            <div class=\"text-center text-expand d-none\">\r\n                                <img src=\"../../../../assets/about-hisense/overview/arrow.svg\"
